In my previous blog post, [Why I Vim]({{ site.url }}{% link _posts/2017-08-02-Why-I-Vim.md %}), I discussed why I use Vim and the advantages I feel Vim has over various editors and IDEs out there.
I would like to discuss in this blog post how I use Vim or more precisely Neovim. I just recently made the switch from [Vim][vim] to [Neovim][nvim] which I feel has many advantages over Vim.

### How Do You Vim?
Good question:

I would quicky identify as a being on the "Dark Side Of Vim" (Using Vim with many plugins).

**A Dark Vimmer**

<div class="breaker"></div>

I use Neovim for everything from writing code and software development (Python, C++ and Scheme) to blogging (using markdown and html) and as a diary, todo and journal (special thanks to [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki)).

I will like to start by listing the most important plugins which should have been included by default in Vim. And do not by any means use any Vim version that is not > Vim 8.0 or Neovim. An easy way to building Vim from source is detailed [here](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source)

* [minpac](https://github.com/k-takata/minpac) - A minimal package manager for Vim 8 and Neovim, or you could use the built in package in Vim 8 and Neovim, a detailed guide from [Vimcast](http://vimcasts.org/) is [here](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/videos/neovim-packages)
* [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) - A git wrapper so awesome, it should be illegal.
* [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) - Used to insert parenthreses, brackets, curly brackets and angle brackets.
* [UltiSnips](https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips) - The ultimate snippet soluton for Vim.
* [nerdcommenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter) - Vim plugin for quickly commenting out sections of code.
* [ALE](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) - For asynchronously linting code as you type, you could also try [Neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake) which is equally as good.
* [DelimitMate](https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate) - Vim plugin, provides insert mode auto-completion for quotes, parens, brackets, etc.
* [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) - A command-line fuzzy finder written in Go, This is both very useful in the command line and in Vim.

While some people make use of a project drawer, I prefer to use the split windows (the built in Netrw) which come with every vim distribution, if you don't feel comfortable using this feel free to use: 
* [NerdTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree).

[Drew Neil](https://github.com/nelstrom) (The Voice of [Vimcast](http://vimcasts.org/)) made a good presentation on the differences and the advantages of using a split window [here](http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/), and he also did a [vimcast](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/the-file-explorer/) on using the Netrw (The built in file explorer)

The Netrw is greatly aided by another [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope) plugin:
* [vim-vinegar](https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar) - combine with netrw to create a delicious salad dressing 

While I have listed basic plugins required for editing and writing code in Vim/Neovim. There are plugins that can greatly improve coding and productivity in Vim.

Subsequent blogs I would talk about setting up Vim/Neovim for Python Development and C++ Development.

Let me include basic plugins that can be used for any kind of development in any language.
* [Deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) for Neovim & [Neocomplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim) for Vim. - Asyncronous completion for framework for Neovim and Vim respectively. Both from the same plugin author [Shougo](https://github.com/Shougo)
* [Floobits](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-vim) - Real-time collaborative editing. Think Etherpad, but with native editors. Great for collaboration from remote locations.

I also use colorschemes to beautify my UI
* [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
* [One Dark](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim)

### Final Note
While this is a peek of the plugins I use (52 plugins and am not afraid to add if the need arises) It shows just what I use Vim and how I use it (On The Dark Side), If you want to get some real supper powered features from vim then

4 months ago, if you had asked had this conversation with me
> You: Why do you use vim ?

> Me:   I'm not really sure, I think every good programmer uses it, and its popular among experienced programmers

> You:  Which do you prefer ? Gvim (gui version of vim) or terminal Vim ?

> Me:   GVim! Because it so much easier to use (with the toolbars and hints) and supports using the mouse very well.

From that conversation I think you can say I never understood at all the power, purpose and reason for Vim. I just used it because it was some norm or hacker culture I had to take part in to be qualified as a good programmer.

Fast forward 5 months later, and I would give you a totally different answer to "Why do use Vim ?" , because that is the only thing I can use, and Which do you prefer, the gui version and the terminal version ?, definitely the terminal version (at least on Linux, not used MacVim). 

Using Vim has made me **lazy** (in a good way though) and far more effective, and has also taught me how to handle fustration (I think everyone feels that way the first time of using it)
